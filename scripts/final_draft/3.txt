"Looking for Salmon Cat Super Rock and Funtime Babysitting Service?" a voice inquired.

"That's us," came the reply.  "We're here about a dog."

"Oh, you're the people from that commercial last night!"  A woman emerged.  "You called it 'stupid.'"

"That's just slang for 'awesome'," the group clarified. "We live in a gated community, not the streets."

"I'm here about my dog.  He was in your commercial!" the woman stated.  "His name is Opie."

"No, it's Cornelius!"  One of the visitors corrected.  "He's a show dog!  We compete in the Winchester Dog Dancing Competition."

"Dog dancing?" the woman asked, incredulous.

"It's dancing... with dogs," they replied patiently.

"May I show you a magic trick?" one of the visitors offered, holding up a bottle.

"Are you threatening my wife?" the woman's husband demanded.

"All three of you," the visitor clarified.  "And that's not your dog!"

A child piped up, "Dad, show them the video!"

The father produced a video. "This is Alexa Bagley and Cornelius at the Winchester Dog Dancing Competition. They've won the last two years."

"No wonder he ran away!" the woman exclaimed.

"That's animal abuse! Making a dog 'Fonzie dance',"  one of the visitors accused.

"I'm sorry.  'Fonzie dance'," the woman corrected herself sheepishly. "He didn't look happy."

"Look at him now!" Dice, one of the visitors, called out.  "Opie!  Give Dice some sugar!" Opie, the dog, licked Dice's face.

"Licking means nothing!" the woman countered.  "You probably just put meat juice on his face."

"No, we didn't!" Dice protested, then paused. "Wait... is meat juice a real thing? Where do I buy it?"

One of the visitors declared, "I know how to solve this. We put Opie in the middle of the room, and we both call him. Whichever one he goes to, he belongs to."

"We're not testingâ€”" the mother began, but was interrupted.

"Hush, mother," her husband said.

"Fine. Let's do it," the woman conceded.

"Stay," the visitors instructed the dog.
