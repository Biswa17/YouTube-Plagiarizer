The often-overlooked kinship between slugs and snails is striking: slugs are simply snails that have evolutionarily lost their shells.  Both are hermaphrodites, and, let's be frank, many are rather unappealing creatures.

Snails boast an astonishing diversity, with over 60,000 species thriving across the globe, including even Antarctica—a distribution mirroring that of PFAS. Their anatomy is remarkable: they can traverse razor-sharp edges unharmed, and some species even possess the ability to walk on water.  However, not all snails are benign; some, such as cone snails, are venomous and cannibalistic, employing harpoon-like teeth to subdue prey, including their own kind.  Size varies dramatically, from minuscule snails small enough to fit through a needle's eye to giants nearing a meter in length and weighing up to 40 pounds. Most snails possess over 14,000 teeth, located on their tongues.  The limpet, though, is an exception, with approximately 1900 teeth, but these are composed of the biologically strongest material known, surpassing even titanium in strength—a fact that suggests cats with such teeth would be the apex predators.

Snails are renowned for their lengthy slumber; they can sleep continuously for up to three years, dedicating roughly one-third of their approximately nine-year lifespan to sleep.  Perhaps we shouldn't judge them too harshly; we humans exhibit similar sleep patterns.


This is a polar bear—or, at least, what a polar bear looks like without its fur.  Beneath that iconic white coat, a polar bear's skin is dark, similar to a brown bear's. The seemingly white fur is actually composed of translucent, hollow hairs, like tiny straws.  The air trapped within these hairs scatters light, creating the illusion of whiteness—a phenomenon similar to how snow, itself colorless, appears white.

Polar bears are marine mammals, akin to whales and seals, spending more than half their lives in the water.  Their webbed feet allow them to swim tirelessly for hundreds of miles, sustaining this effort for up to nine days. Their primary prey is seals; the high vitamin A content in seals results in polar bear livers containing enough vitamin A to be lethal to 52 humans.

Confusion sometimes arises regarding polar bear habitat—Arctic or Antarctic?  A simple mnemonic helps: "Arctic" implies the presence of bears, while "Antarctic" means "no bears."  Penguins inhabit the Antarctic, making encounters between polar bears and penguins impossible.  However, interspecies breeding isn't unheard of: polar bears have been documented mating with grizzly bears, producing offspring known as pizzlies or grolars, depending on the parent's sex.

Speaking of penguins, consider this: how long could you maintain a squat position?  A few seconds? Minutes, perhaps?  Examine a penguin skeleton, and you'll see this is their natural posture—their lifelong stance.

Penguins consume salty seawater and seafood, necessitating a specialized salt gland above their eyes that filters salt from their bloodstream, excreting the excess through their beaks. They're surprisingly athletic jumpers; emperor and Adélie penguins can leap approximately 10 feet vertically from the water—the height of a single-story building.  Emperor penguin chicks take this a step further, launching themselves from heights of 50 feet.


The maternal instincts of some penguins are... unconventional. A mother penguin whose chick has died may resort to chick-napping, stealing another pair's chick while the parents are momentarily distracted.  After about a week, she abandons the stolen chick, often resulting in its death.  Some emperor penguins inexplicably abandon their colonies, waddling towards the Antarctic mountains.  Returning them only results in their repeating this behavior. The reasons behind this remain a mystery. And, let’s not forget, penguins are frequent defecators, leaving droppings approximately every 20 minutes.


In stark contrast to penguins, some creatures, remarkably, almost never defecate, utilizing their ingested food entirely for energy. Imagine having a mouth but no digestive tract, only a long straw for sustenance! These curious beings employ their antennae for smell and their feet for taste.


Butterflies exhibit a remarkable range in size and variety, encompassing over 17,000 species, from tiny two-centimeter specimens to giants nearing a foot in length. Some species, like pipevine and monarch butterflies, are poisonous. Monarch butterflies are famous for their epic 3,000-mile migrations. (We'll discuss monarch butterfly mating in a future video.)


Butterflies primarily feed on plant nectar and sap, but they’re also opportunistic feeders; they may supplement their diets with mud, feces, sweat, urine, and even blood, seeking essential nutrients and salts not found in their usual food sources.  Harvester butterflies exhibit a carnivorous tendency, consuming aphid excrement.  (Aphids, incidentally, are sap-sucking insects.)  Caterpillars, however, take this a step further, directly consuming aphids.

Caterpillars possess an astonishing 4,000 muscles, far exceeding the human count of 629.  While the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly is well-known, the process itself is extraordinary: the caterpillar dissolves into a liquid before reforming as a butterfly.  Remarkably, butterflies retain memories from their caterpillar stage.


Crows are among the most intelligent species on Earth, possessing an understanding of mortality.  Unlike humans, they engage in thoughtful decision-making and participate in elaborate mourning rituals for deceased relatives and friends, often performing a kind of postmortem examination to try to determine cause of death.  Murder within the flock is punishable by death. This may be the origin of the collective noun for crows: a murder.

Crows are highly social, with adult crows eventually leaving the family group to establish their own territories.  However, they maintain contact with their parents, occasionally visiting to check on their well-being and even assisting in raising subsequent generations.  They're also largely monogamous, forming lifelong pair bonds, a model of commitment often exceeding that of humans.

Crows display remarkable memory and a strong sense of reciprocity.  Kindness or harm directed toward a crow will be remembered—and reciprocated—for up to five years, even if the individual is masked.  This information is shared within the crow community and may even be passed down to future generations.


Rabbits are remarkably efficient converters of food into body mass, a feat partly attributed to their consumption of their own feces.  They produce two types of feces: ordinary feces and a nutrient-rich type called cecotropes, which they directly consume from their anus. This is usually unnoticed by owners.

While seemingly unsanitary, this behavior is essential because rabbits cannot vomit.  The ingestion of cecotropes is crucial for obtaining necessary nutrients, and prevents poisoning.  Their teeth grow continuously, requiring constant grinding against rough substances like hay and grass.  A diet lacking these can lead to teeth piercing their skulls.  Avoid excessive fruit and carrot feeding—these are soft foods that are detrimental to their dental health.

Rabbits communicate through a variety of behaviors, such as jumps and thumps, rather than vocalizations.  Their visual field is nearly 360 degrees, though they possess a blind spot directly in front of their noses. Their sense of smell is exceptional, operating through both nose and mouth.

Rabbits are surprisingly fragile; a sudden loud noise can induce fatal heart attacks. Conversely, they are among the world's fastest breeding mammals.  (Their reproductive habits will be detailed in a future video).

This isn't an axolotl—not this one, and not this one either.  The characteristic feathery gills, long tail, and juvenile appearance often lead to misidentification.  Axolotls are salamanders, with over 700 species.  Many larval salamanders share this similar appearance.  So, why are axolotls more well-known? Unlike most salamanders, axolotls retain their larval characteristics throughout their lives—a phenomenon known as neoteny.  Rarely, however, they undergo metamorphosis into their adult salamander form.  Axolotls are endemic to a single location: Lake Xochimilco near Mexico City.

Their regenerative abilities are astounding: severed limbs, tails, brains, hearts, lungs, and even spinal cords regrow completely.  This has made them invaluable subjects in laboratory research for over 150 years, fueling hopes for human limb regeneration.

Axolotls' regenerative capacity extends to surgical oddities.  A severed limb reattached to a different location will fuse and function, sometimes even resulting in a new limb growing in the original position, creating a five-legged axolotl.  Scientists have attempted to create chimeric axolotls through various techniques, including grafting limbs and tails, and even attempting to create two-headed axolotls.  While a two-headed axolotl's potential was briefly observed before the body healed, the goal remains elusive.  In short, their remarkable regenerative abilities continue to fascinate scientists, as does their general overall weirdness.
