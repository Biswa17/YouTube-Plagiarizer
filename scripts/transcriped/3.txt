"What's up?"

"We're looking for Salmon Cat Super Rock and Funtime Babysitting Service?"

"Sure, come on in."

"Hi! Do you want us to babysit this little girl? 'Cause she's kind of old."

"I don't need a babysitter. I'm here about my dog."

"We want our dog back!"

"What dog? The one that was in your stupid television commercial last night."

"Yay! They saw our commercial!"

"They called it stupid."

"That's just street talk for good. You know, like, 'Yo, man, that girl is stupid!'"

"You hear that a lot, do you?"

"We are not from the streets."

"We live in a gated community."

"And the dog that was in your commercial is my dog."

"Oh, no, that was my dog, Opie."

"His name is Cornelius."

"Cornelius?"

"Look, you want to see my dog?"

"Opie, come on, buddy! Come on! Cornelius!"

"Give me my dog!"

"He's my dog!"

"No, that's our dog. We lost him six months ago."

"Well, Dice has had Opie a lot longer than six months, right? How long you had him for?"

"About six months."

"Well, where did you get him?"

"I found him in the alley on my way home from school. I saw him there like five days in a row, sniffing around for food, and he didn't have a collar, so I just took him home."

"Well, Cornelius is ours, and he happens to be a show dog. We compete in the Winchester Dog Dancing Competition every year."

"What is dog dancing?"

"It's dancing with dogs."

"Which word didn't you understand?"

"How would you like to see me do a really neat magic trick with this bottle?"

"Are you threatening my wife?"

"No. I'm threatening all three of you!"

"And he's not your dog!"

"Dad, show them the video."

"Yes, sweetheart. Look at this."

"This is Alexa Bagley and Cornelius's third year at the Winchester Dog Dancing Competition. Look at Cornelius's form! They've won the last two years in a row. Looks like another win for Alexa and Cornelius!"

"Oh, no wonder he ran away!"

"Excuse me? That's abusive, making a dog Fonzie dance."

"Oh, I'm sorry. Fonzie dance."

"Yeah, he didn't look very happy."

"And look at him now!"

"Hey, Opie! Give Dice some sugar."

"See? He loves Dice!"

"Licking means nothing!"

"Yeah, you probably just rubbed meat juice on his face."

"No, we didn't!"

"Hold up! Wait a minute! Is meat juice a real thing? Where would I buy that?"

"All right, I know how to solve this."

"Ooh, Dice has a plan. What's the plan?"

"All right, so we put Opie in the middle of the room."

"Cornelius!"

"We put him in the middle of the room, and then we both call him and see who he comes to."

"No, we're not testâ€”"

"Hush, mother."

"Let's do it."

"Good. Fine. Let's go."

"Stay, stay!"
