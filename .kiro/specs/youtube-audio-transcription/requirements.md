# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to extract audio from YouTube videos and transcribe the audio content into text. The application will provide a simple web interface where users can input a YouTube URL, and the system will process the video to extract audio and generate a text transcription using automated speech recognition.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit a YouTube video URL through a web form, so that I can initiate the audio extraction and transcription process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the main page THEN the system SHALL display a form with a YouTube URL input field and submit button
2. WHEN a user enters a valid YouTube URL THEN the system SHALL accept the input and proceed with processing
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid URL THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the URL format is incorrect
4. WHEN a user submits an empty form THEN the system SHALL display a validation error requiring a URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to extract audio from the provided YouTube video, so that the audio content can be processed for transcription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid YouTube URL is submitted THEN the system SHALL download the video content
2. WHEN the video is downloaded THEN the system SHALL extract the audio track in a suitable format (MP3 or WAV)
3. WHEN the audio extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user
4. WHEN the video is unavailable or restricted THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the video cannot be processed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extracted audio to be automatically transcribed into text, so that I can read the spoken content of the video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL process the audio file through a speech-to-text service
2. WHEN transcription is successful THEN the system SHALL display the transcribed text to the user
3. WHEN transcription fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the transcription could not be completed
4. WHEN the audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL still attempt transcription and indicate if confidence is low

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the processing status while my video is being processed, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a URL THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator or progress message
2. WHEN audio extraction begins THEN the system SHALL update the status to indicate extraction is in progress
3. WHEN transcription begins THEN the system SHALL update the status to indicate transcription is in progress
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display the final results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to copy or download the transcribed text, so that I can use it in other applications or save it for later reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL display the text in a copyable format
2. WHEN a user clicks a copy button THEN the system SHALL copy the transcribed text to the clipboard
3. WHEN a user requests download THEN the system SHALL provide the transcription as a downloadable text file
4. WHEN the transcription is long THEN the system SHALL format it with proper line breaks and paragraphs for readability
